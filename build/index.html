Smith
pledged to pay off the student loan debt for the entire graduating class <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/19/education/morehouse-college-robert-f-smith.html">Source</a>.</p><p>The combined debt for the 400 graduating seniors amounted to approximately $40 million, or about $100,000 per person.</p><p>What kind of financial impact do these student loans have on the lives of students? We will walk you through the basics of student loans, and discuss the process of paying them back.</p><h2>Our Average Debt</h2><p>To start, the <a href="https://www.debt.org/students/">average student debt</a> of a graduating senior in the US for the class of 2017 was $37,712.
For context, with that money you could buy a new luxury car, 3 years of rent in Evanston, or 37 iPhone X.</p><div><img src="static/images/avg_debt.png" class="car"/></div><br/><br/><br/><p>The graph below shows the average student debt at graduation for students in the Big 10.

Furthermore, this figure represents a 129% increase since 2008.</p><p>But why is student loan debt growing so quickly? At least part of the answer lies in the rising tuition costs of attending university.</p><h2>Rising Tuition Costs</h2><p>It is no secret that over the past 30 years college has gotten a lot more expensive. Even when adjusted for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/29/how-much-college-tuition-has-increased-from-1988-to-2018.html">inflation</a>, on average, students must pay over 2.5 times as much to attend university as those who attended university 30 years ago.</p><p>The graph below shows the average tuition of private and public schools in current US dollars.<div style="width:100%"></div><caption>Average Tuition in Current USD Source: <a href="https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/tuition-fees-room-and-board-over-time">CollegeBoard</a></caption></p><p>College tuition prices have risen faster than housing <a href="https://www.nas.org/blogs/dicta/college_tuition_vs_home_prices_vs_cpi_no_comment">prices</a>, <a href="https://college-education.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=005532">wages</a>, and overall <a href="https://inflationdata.com/articles/charts/college-tuition-fees-inflation/">inflation</a>.</p><p>As a result, many students are taking out loans to help pay for their college educations, and poor planning or a lack of knowledge about these loans can become a major problem later on in life.</p><h2>How much could you pay?</h2><p>When you borrow $1,000 from the bank, you pay back $1,000, right? Not exactly. When taking out a loan, there are a variety of choices you will make that will impact how much you actually end up paying for your loan. It can be hard to understand how interest rates, loan terms, payment plans, and everything else involved in a loan come together to form the number of your monthly bill. We’re here to help.</p><h2>Expected Debt</h2><p>How much you need in student loans can be tricky to figure out. Even if you are in need of some form of financial aid, loans are not the only way to help pay for school. Some people may receive grants, which do not need to be repaid, while other may get a work study job.</p><p>
Expected Debt: <input type="range" value="37712" min="0" max="300000" step="5000"/> <span class="idyll-display">37712.00</span></p><h2>Interest Rate</h2><p>Whenever you take out a loan, the agency providing you with the loan will charge you interest. Interest rates vary widely depending on the type of loan and the borrower. For undergraduates seeking federal student loans in 2019, the <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/interest-rates#rates">interest rate</a> is 5.05%.</p><p>Due to interest, you will end up paying more than just the upfront principle of the loan - the higher the interest rate or the longer you take to pay off the loan, the more you’ll end up paying in interest.</p><p>
Interest Rate: <input type="text" value="5.5"/></p><h2>Loan Term</h2><p>When you borrow anything you will have a due date, and loans are no exception. The term of a loan is the amount of time you will have to pay it back. Loan terms can be anything from a few months to thirty years. Student loans typically have a term of 10-15 years. While a longer term loan may appear more attractive because you have more time to pay it back, it’s important to carefully compare shorter-term and longer-term loans - due to interest, you may end up paying more in the long run.</p><div class="float left" style="float:left;width:50%">
  Loan Term:  <span class="idyll-display">10.00</span><input type="range" value="10" min="10" max="30" step="10"/></div><br/><br/><br/><h2>Payment Amount</h2><p>At some point, you have to start paying back the money you borrowed, and you will start making monthly payments to repay your loans. Payments for student loans typically start six months after you graduate.</p><p>On your bill, there will be a minimum monthly payment, and you have to pay at least that much every month. Be careful though - as we discussed in the previous section, the longer it takes to pay back a loan, the more interest you’ll end up paying. Paying more than the minimum when you can will end up saving you money in the long run.</p><div class="float left" style="float:left;width:50%">

You can adjust the parameters you entered above to see how different combinations of interest, term, and payment can affect how much you end up paying for your loan.</p><p>The <span class="blue"> <strong>blue</strong> </span> line shows how long it would take you to pay off your loan by paying the minimum amount, and the <span class="blue"> <strong>blue</strong> </span> bar shows how much interest you will have paid over the life of the loan. 
You can experiment with the monthly payment to see how paying more money changes your loan term, shown in the <span class="green"> <strong>green</strong> </span> line, and the overall interest paid in the <span class="green"> <strong>green</strong> </span> bar. </p><div class="float left" style="float:left;width:50%">
